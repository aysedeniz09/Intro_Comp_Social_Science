## Computational Social Science

.center[
.big[
**Integration of computational methods to study human behavior and societal phenomena at scale.**

Addresses complex questions from inequality to information diffusion.
]
]

--

Where do we use it?
- Social networks, spatial data, behavioral data analysis, anything that has human and data.

--

What is the main concern?
- Bridging methodological and disciplinary gaps

---

## Explanation vs. Prediction

- Social Sciences: Focus on causal explanations tied to theory.

--

- Computer Sciences: Emphasis on prediction accuracy over causation.

--

- Result: Divergent epistemic values, with potential for integration through "quadrant frameworks" (Hofman et al., 2021)

Class Question:
- How can CSS reconcile causal explanation with predictive accuracy?

---

## Quadrant Framework for Modeling (Hofman et al., 2021)

| Focus                           | No Intervention/Static World             | Intervention/Changing World               |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Specific Features or Effects**| **Descriptive (Q1):** Describes relationships; foundational for CSS. | **Explanatory (Q2):** Estimates causal effects; lacks predictive power. |
| **Predicting Outcomes**         | **Predictive (Q3):** Accurate forecasts; ignores causality.          | **Integrative (Q4):** Combines causality and prediction; sparsely explored. |
| **Implications**                | *Foundational data insights for CSS.*   | *Bridging Q2 and Q3 enhances real-world applicability and theoretical grounding.* |


Class Question:
- What examples in CSS work exemplify integrative modeling?

---

## Institutional Challenges

1. Data Silos: 
   - Limited interdisciplinary collaboration within academia.
2. Infrastructure: 
   - Lack of shared, secure, and large-scale research data facilities.
3. Ethics: 
   - Inadequate guidelines for privacy, consent, and data usage in digital trace research.
4. Opportunities: 
   - Foster cross-disciplinary hubs, secure data environments, and open science practices (Lazer et al., 2020).

Class Question: 
- How can universities restructure to support CSS better?

---

## Data Access and Ethics

- Private Data

--
    - Limited due to proprietary concerns and regulatory hurdles.
    
--

- Public Data 

--

   - Often poorly structured for CSS needs.

--

- Solutions

--

   - Develop shared, privacy-preserving data centers; establish enforceable data-sharing agreements.

--

- Ethical Considerations 

--

   - Promote transparency, replicability, and fairness in algorithmic research

---

## Methodological Innovations

- Pre-registration - From explanatory to predictive modeling.
- Common Task Framework - Centralizing research problems for comparability.
- Hybrid Approaches - Using machine learning to enhance causal inference.
- Future Work - Addressing generalizability across interventions and distributions

---

## Practical Recommendations

What are some solutions?

--

- Enhance Collaboration - reward interdisciplinary efforts.
- Improve Training - merge computational and social science pedagogy.
- Solve Real-world Problems - align research outputs with societal needs like public health and equity

## Intro to R Studio

RStudio is an **integrated development environment (IDE)** for R, a programming language widely used for data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization


![Steps](images/Rconsole.jpg)
---

### R Studio: The Console

The Console is where you directly interact with R. You can type R commands, hit Enter, and see the immediate results.

Key Features:
- Executes code line-by-line.
- Useful for quick calculations or testing small snippets of code.
- Does not save commands—once you close RStudio, the history of commands in the Console is gone unless explicitly saved.

***TRY: write `2 + 2` in the console and press Enter.***

<img src="images/Rconsole2.png" width=50%>

---

### R Studio: The Terminal

The Terminal is separate from the Console and provides access to your computer's command-line interface (CLI).

Key Features:
- Allows you to run system-level commands (e.g., navigating file systems, managing files).
- Useful for integrating with tools like Git or installing software packages.

Key Difference from Console: 
- The Console is R-specific, while the Terminal is for general command-line tasks. 

<mark>We will not use Terminal most of the time</mark>

***TRY: In the Terminal, type `ls` (Mac/Linux) or `dir` (Windows) to list files in your current directory.***

<img src="images/Rterminal.png" width=50%>

---

### RStudio: Project

An RStudio Project is a way to organize your work by grouping files, data, and scripts for a specific task or analysis.

Why Use Projects?
- Keeps your workspace clean and focused.
- Automatically sets the working directory to the project folder.
- Ensures reproducibility by keeping everything needed for a project in one place.

How to Create a Project:
1. Click on **<span class="inline-button">File → New Project....</span>**.
2. Choose whether to create a new directory, use an existing directory, or clone a Git repository.
3. Give it a name and location.


***TRY: Create a project called "EMS747_Class_Exercises" and notice how RStudio creates a .Rproj file for managing it.***

---

### RStudio: Project (continued)

<img src="images/Rproject.jpg">

---

### RStudio: Script

A script is a text file where you write and save R code for future use.
- Scripts let you document your work, making it reproducible and shareable.
- You can save time by re-running pre-written code instead of typing commands repeatedly.
How to Create and Use a Script:
- Click on **<span class="inline-button">File → New File → R Script</span>**.
- Write R code in the script editor. 
- E.g.
```{r eval=TRUE}
x <- 5
y <- 10
z <- x + y
print(z)
```

- Highlight the code you want to run and press **<span class="inline-button">Ctrl+Enter</span>** (Windows/Linux) or **<span class="inline-button">Cmd+Enter</span>** (Mac) to execute it in the Console.

### R Markdown in R Studio

- [R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rmarkdown.html) is a framework that allows you to integrate code, output, and narrative in one document.
- You can produce reports in multiple formats: HTML, PDF, Word, etc.

Why do we use R Markdown?
- Combine code and text for reproducible research.
- Create interactive and visually appealing documents.
- Easy to share analyses with others.

[R Markdown Cheathseet](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-15.HTML)

---

### How to create a document in R Markdown

- Click on **<span class="inline-button">File</span>** > **<span class="inline-button">New File</span>** > **<span class="inline-button">R Markdown</span>**.
- Choose a title, author, and output format (HTML, PDF, or Word).
- Edit the template provided in the new .Rmd file.
- <mark> For our class you can use the Markdown from BB and take notes on that!</mark>

To run code you use code Chunks
- Surround code chunks with `{r}` at the beginning and close them with three backticks at the end.
- or use the Insert Code Chunk button. Add a chunk label and/or chunk options inside the curly braces after r.

### R: Basic Grammar

#### Variable Assignment

Variables are used to store data or values. 

`=` (Simple Assignment) **Similar to python**

<mark>`<-` (Leftward Assignment) **Most Common used by R coders and we will use this**</mark>

`->` (Rightward Assignment) **Rarely used**

.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}

x = "Simple_Assignment" 
print(x)

y <- "Leftward Assignment"
print(y)

"Rightward_Assignment" -> z
print(z)

```

]

---

### R is case-sensitive

```{r, eval=TRUE, error=TRUE}

x <- 2

print(X)

```

It gave an error, why? 

--

Cause R is <mark> case sensitive </mark>

```{r, eval=TRUE}
print(x)
```

---

### Comments

To comment - Comments are notes in the code that R ignores. Use `#` to write comments.
- R only has single line comments so if you want multiple lines you need to repeat the `#` for each line. 

```{r}

variable_2 <- "Leftward Assignment" ## this is the most common used by R coders
# Other's work as well 

```

---

### R Reserved Keywords

You cannot use these keywords as variable names. These are reserved keywords for R.

.pull-left[

| Words    | Description                                                       |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|

]

.pull-right[
| Words         | Description                                                       |

| NA_real_      | Represents a missing real (numeric) value.                       |
]

### Data Types

.pull-left[- Numeric: Numbers 
   - e.g., `3.14`, `42`
- Character: Text or strings
   - e.g., `"Hello"`, `"R"`
- Logical: Boolean values 
   - `TRUE`, `FALSE`
- Factor: Categorical data
   - e.g., `"Male"`, `"Female"`

- You can use `typeof()` to see what type of data it is
   
**TRY: Writing different data types**
]

.pull-right[
.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
age <- 25  # Numeric
typeof(age)

name <- "Alice"  # Character
typeof(name)

is_student <- TRUE  # Logical
typeof(is_student)
```

]
]

Question? What is double?

---

**TRY: Create variables and see what types they are

```{r}

```

---

### Dates

- Date: Represents calendar dates.
   - e.g., "2023-01-01"
- `POSIXct/POSIXlt`: Represents date and time.
   - e.g., "2023-01-01 12:34:56"
- R uses the `Date` and `POSIXct/POSIXlt` classes for working with dates and times.
- Use `as.Date()` to convert strings to dates.
- Use `Sys.Date()` for the current date.
- Use `Sys.time()` for the current date and time.

.pull-left[
.small-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
a <- "2023-01-01"
typeof(a)

b <- as.Date(a)
typeof(b)
```
]
]


.pull-right[
**TRY: Converting strings to dates**

.small-code[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Convert a string to a date
my_date <- as.Date("2023-01-01")
typeof(my_date)

# Get the current date
today <- Sys.Date()

# Add 7 days to a date
future_date <- today + 7

# Display the date and class
print(future_date)
class(future_date)
```
]
]

---

### Basic Arithmetic

.pull-left[
Operators in R:
- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Exponentiation: `^`
]

.pull-right[
**TRY**
.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
a <- 10
b <- 3

sum <- a + b  # Addition
print(sum)  

product <- a * b  # Multiplication
print(product)

power <- a ^ b  # Exponentiation
print(power)

```
]
]

---

**TRY**
- Create variables and use basic artithmetics, I started for you play with them more!  

```{r}

x<-20
x<-5
x
y<-10
x*y

```

---

### Vectors

A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same type.
- Creating Vectors: Use the `c()` function.

**TRY**
.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # Numeric vector
names <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")  # Character vector
is_student <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)  # Logical vector

```

**TRY what types they are**
```{r}
typeof(numbers)
```

]

You can access an element in a vector with square brackets `[]`

.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
print(numbers[2])  # Prints the second element of the vector
```
]

---

### Vectors beyond numbers

.pull-left[
- Vectors can hold various types of data, including:
   - Character: Strings of text.
   - Numeric: Numbers.
   -Logical: TRUE, FALSE.

.tiny-code[
```{r}
phrase <- "Vectors are fun!"
phrase

fruits <- c("Banana", "Mango", "Strawberry", "Grapes")  # ADD YOUR FAVORITES!
fruits
```
]
]

.pull-right[

- You can again access it using `[]` square brackets, try it yourself! 
.tiny-code[
```{r}
fruits[2]  # Access the 2nd item

```

]
]

---

### Vector functions

.pull-left[
- Access specific items with `[]` (we practices above)
- `length()`: Finds the number of elements in a vector.
]


.pull-right[
.tiny-code[
```{r, error=TRUE}
# Vector properties
length(fruits)       # Number of elements
fruits * 2           # Produces an ERROR
1:length(fruits)     # Sequence from 1 to the vector length
fruits[2:3]          # Access multiple items
fruits[-c(1, 4)]     # Exclude items 1 and 4
```
]

Why does `fruits * 2` produce an error? 
]


---

### Vectors continued, sequences

.pull-left[
We can create sequences with vectors using `:`

.small-code[
```{r}
A <- 11:20
print(A)

B <- 0:10
print(B)

```
]

]

.pull-right[
**TRY: Vector functions with your number vectors**

.small-code[
```{r}
# Vector properties
length(A)       # Number of elements
B * 2           # This time no error
1:length(A)     # Sequence from 1 to the vector length
B[2:3]          # Access multiple items
A[-c(1, 4)]     # Exclude items 1 and 4
```
]
]


---

### Vector Indexing

.pull-left[
- Access items with `[]`
- Exclude an item with `-`:

```{r}
fruits[3]  # Third item

fruits[c(1, 4)]  # First and fourth items

fruits[-2]  # Exclude the second item

```

Practice:
- How do you select only items 1, 3, and 5?
- How do you exclude items 2 and 4? ]

.pull-right[ 
.tiny-code[
```{r}
# Selecting items:
fruits[c(1, 3, 5)]

# Excluding items:
fruits[-c(2, 4)]

# Saving a subset:
favorite_fruits <- fruits[c(1, 3)]
favorite_fruits
```

] ]

---

### Combining Vectors

.pull-left[
Combine vectors of different types:
```{r}
numbers <- 1:5
text <- "Hello"
combo <- c(numbers, text)
combo
```

Type Coercion:
- R converts all elements in a vector to the same type.
- Order of precedence:
   - `Character > Numeric > Logical`. 
]

.pull-right[ 
```{r}
typeof(numbers)      # "integer"
typeof(text)         # "character"
typeof(combo)        # "character"
```

Practice:
- Combine a vector of numbers and a vector of colors.
- Check the resulting vector's type using `typeof()`.
```{r}

```
]

---

### Vectors class exercises

1\. Create a vector of your favorite hobbies.
   - Access the first two items.
   - Exclude the last item.
```{r}
```

2\. Combine vectors of numbers and character strings.
   - What is the type of the resulting vector?
   - What happens if you add `TRUE` to the vector?

```{r}
numbers <- 1:3
strings <- c("One", "Two", "Three")
combined <- c(numbers, strings)
```

---

### Vectors and Arithmetics

We can also do artihmetics with vectors! 

.small-code[
```{r}
A + B
```
]

What will happen if we vectors of different sizes?
.small-code[
```{r}
D <- 20:24
E <- 25:30

D+E

```
]

R applies **recycling** which means...
- D (length 5) is recycled to match the length of E (length 6).
   - D becomes: 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 20 (repeating the first element).
- Then, element-wise addition is performed:
   - `(20 + 25), (21 + 26), (22 + 27), (23 + 28), (24 + 29), (20 + 30)`
   - `r D + E`

---

### From Vectors to Data Frames

A data frame is a table-like structure (multiple vectors combined into rows and column) in R where each column can have a different data type (numeric, character, logical, etc.). Think of it as a spreadsheet where each column is a variable, and each row is an observation.

#### 1\. Create a dataframe
   - Use the `data.frame()` function to create a data frame.

.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Create a data frame
df <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Ayse", "Jessy", "Chris"),  # Character column
  Age = c(25, 30, 35),  # Numeric column
  Professor = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)  # Logical column
)

# Print the data frame
print(df)

### OR

Name <- c("Ayse", "Jessy", "Chris")  # Character column
Age <- c(25, 30, 35)  # Numeric column
Professor <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)  # Logical column

df <- data.frame(Name, Age, Professor)
print(df)
```
]

---

#### <mark>Vectors in a data frame must have the same length!!</mark>

```{r, error=TRUE}
# Mismatched lengths will fail
names <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
ages <- c(25, 30)  # Fewer elements
people <- data.frame(names, ages)  # ERROR
```

Let's fix the error
```{r}
# Fix the error:
ages <- c(25, 30, 35)
people <- data.frame(names, ages)
people
```

---

**TRY: Practice creating a dataframe**

1. Create a vector of your favorite sports.
   - Select items 2 through 4.
   - Exclude item 1.
2. Combining Vectors:
   - Combine a vector of numbers `(1:5)` with a vector of shapes `("Circle", "Square", "Triangle")`.
   - Check the type of the resulting vector.
3. Building Data Frames:
   - Create a data frame with `us_df`:
      - `us_cities <- c("Boston", "Chicago", "Seattle")`
      - `us_populations <- c(700000, 2700000, 750000)`
   - Create another data frame with `asia_df`:
     - `asia_cities <- c("Beijing", "Shanghai", "Taipei", "Kaohsiung")`
     - `asia_populations <- c(21540000, 24280000, 2640000, 2775000)`
  - Create a data frame with your own set of favorite cities (at least 3) and estimated populations.
  - Add more cities to the asia_df:
     - Include "Guangzhou" with a population of 18,810,000.
     - Include "New Taipei City" with a population of 4,000,000.
  - Combine all cities into one data frame:
     - Merge US and Asian city data frames into one combined table.
```{r}
```

---

#### 2\. Explore/Inspect a Data Frame

.pull-left[
Basic Functions to Explore a Data Frame:
- `head(df)`: Displays the first 6 rows of the data frame.
- `tail(df)`: Displays the last 6 rows.
- `dim(df)`: Returns the dimensions (rows, columns).
- `str(df)`: Shows the structure of the data frame, including data types.
- `summary(df)`: Provides summary statistics for each column.
.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
head(df)        # First 6 rows
tail(df)        # Last 6 rows
```
]
]

.pull-right[
.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}

dim(df)         # Dimensions: rows and columns
str(df)         # Structure
summary(df)     # Summary statistics
```
]
]

---

#### 3\. Accessing Data in a Data Frame

.pull-left[
Accessing Columns:
- Use the `$` operator: `df$ColumnName`.
- Use bracket notation: `df[ , "ColumnName"]`.

.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
print(df$Name)  # Access the 'Name' column
print(df[, "Age"])  # Access the 'Age' column
```

]
]

.pull-right[
Accessing Rows:
- Use bracket notation with a row index: `df[row_number, ]`.
.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
print(df[1, ])  # Access the first row
```
]

Accessing Specific Elements:
Use `df[row, column]`.
.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
print(df[2, 3])  # Access the element in the 2nd row and 3rd column
```
]
]

---

#### 4\. Adding and Removing Data

.pull-left[
<mark> Don't forget `[row, column]`</mark>
<br>
Adding Columns: Use the `$` operator or bracket notation to add a new column.
.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
df$Graduation <- c("2021", "2026", "2019")  # Add a new column 'Graduation'
print(df)
```
]

Adding Rows: Use the `rbind()` function.
.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
new_row <- data.frame(Name = "Donpeng", Age = 28, Professor = FALSE, Graduation = "2025")
df <- rbind(df, new_row)  # Add a new row
print(df)

```
]
]

.pull-right[
Removing Columns: Use the `NULL` assignment, `-` or subset the data frame.

.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
df$Graduation <- NULL  # Remove the 'Graduation' column
print(df)

```
]

.tiny-code[
```{r}
df2 <- df[,-3]
print(df2)
```
]

Same with rows, use `-`.
.tiny-code[
```{r}
df3 <- df[-2,]
print(df3)
```
]
]

#### 5\. Data Manupulations

Manipulating data is key to preparing it for analysis.
Common tasks:
- Filtering rows.
- Selecting columns.
- Sorting data.
- Aggregating data.

---

#### 6\. Filtering and Subsetting Data

.pull-left[
Filtering Rows: Use logical conditions inside square brackets.
<br>
**TRY: Filter rows where Age > 25**

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Filter rows where Age > 25
df_filtered <- df[df$Age > 25, ]
print(df_filtered)
```
]

.pull-right[
Selecting Specific Columns: Use column indices or names.
<br>
**TRY: Select only 'Name' and 'Age' columns**
```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Select only 'Name' and 'Age' columns
df_subset <- df[, c("Name", "Age")]
print(df_subset)
```
]


---

#### 7\. Ordering Data

Rearrange rows based on column values.

**TRY: Sort by Age in ascending order**

.small-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Sort by Age in ascending order
sorted_df <- df[order(df$Age), ]
```
]

**TRY: Sort rows by Name in alphabetical order.**
```{r}
```

---

#### 8\. Common Data Frame Functions

- `nrow(df)`: Returns the number of rows.
- `ncol(df)`: Returns the number of columns.
- `colnames(df)`: Returns column names.
- `rownames(df)`: Returns row names.
- `merge(df1, df2)`: Combines two data frames by matching rows. *We will learn to do this in Tidy next week*

---

#### 9\. Basic Aggregations

Compute summary statistics (e.g., mean, sum) for groups of data.

**TRY: **

.small-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Example: Calculate mean Age by Student status
result <- aggregate(Age ~ Professor, data = df, FUN = mean)
print(result)

```
]

**TRY: Try with other functions such as `max()`, `min()`, `sum()`, and others**


---

### Class Exercise

1. Create a Data Frame: Create a data frame of your favorite movies, including columns for Title, Year, and Rating.

2. Filter Rows: Filter the data frame to show only movies released after 2010.

3. Add a New Column: Add a column indicating whether the movie has won an Oscar (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).

---

### Functions

Functions perform specific tasks. They take inputs (arguments) and return outputs.
- Syntax: `function_name(arguments)`

**TRY**
.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
sum_result <- sum(c(1, 2, 3))  # Sum of a vector
print(sum_result) 

mean_result <- mean(c(4, 5, 6))  # Mean of a vector
print(mean_result) 

```
]

---

### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to perform different actions based on conditions.
- Keywords: `if`, `else if`, `else`

**TRY**
.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
x <- 15

if (x > 10) {
  print("x is greater than 10")
} else if (x == 10) {
  print("x is equal to 10")
} else {
  print("x is less than 10")
}
```

]

---

### Loops

Loops allow repetitive tasks to be automated.

Common Loops:
.pull-left[
- `for`: Iterates over a sequence.
.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
# for loop
for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i)
}
```
]
]

.pull-right[
- `while`: Repeats as long as a condition is TRUE.
.tiny-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
# while loop
x <- 1
while (x <= 5) {
  print(x)
  x <- x + 1
}

```
]
]

---

### What is Regex (Regular Expression)?
- A regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern.
- Used for:
   - Matching patterns in text.
   - Extracting or replacing specific text.
   - Validating strings (e.g., usernames, email addresses).
- Easily process large text datasets.
- Clean and analyze text data efficiently.

---

### RegEx Basic Syntax

[Regex Cheat Sheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/regex.pdf)

We will use the [`stringr` package](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) 

.small-code[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("stringr")
```
]

.small-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(stringr)
```
]

.small-code[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
regex_table <- data.frame(
  `Regex Pattern` = c(".", "^", "$", "*", "+", "[]", "|"),
  `Matches` = c(
    "Any single character",
    "Start of a string",
    "End of a string",
    "Zero or more of the preceding character",
    "One or more of the preceding character",
    "Match any character in the set",
    "Logical OR"
  ),
  `Example` = c(
    '"Mario1" matches "M.rio1"',
    '"^Zelda" matches "Zelda..."',
    '"end$" matches "The end"',
    '"A*B" matches "AAAB"',
    '"Go+" matches "Gooo"',
    '"[PS]" matches "P", "S"',
    '"Mario|Zelda" matches either'
  )
)

kable(regex_table, caption = "Regex Patterns and Examples")
```
]

---

### Extract Text

Let's create a dataset:

.small-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
reviews <- c(
  "The new Mario Kart is amazing!",
  "Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterpiece.",
  "I can't wait for Final Fantasy XVI.",
  "Have you tried playing God of War: Ragnarok?",
  "Elden Ring redefined the RPG genre."
)
```

]

Let's extract the titles: Maria Kart, Zelda, Final Fantasy XVI, God of War: Ragnarok

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Extract video game titles using regex
titles <- str_extract(reviews, "Mario Kart|Zelda: Breath of the Wild|Final Fantasy XVI|God of War: Ragnarok|Elden Ring")

print(titles)

```


---

### Validate Text & Data

You can use regex to validate if a text or pattern of text is in your data


```{r, eval=TRUE}
game_codes <- c("GAME-1234", "INVALID", "PLAY-5678", "GAMEX-9999", "GAME-567")
valid_codes <- str_detect(game_codes, "^(GAME|PLAY)-\\d{4}$")

print(valid_codes)
```


---

### Extract using a pattern

Let's extract years --- numbers of 4 digits

```{r, eval=TRUE}
release_info <- c(
  "The Legend of Zelda was released in 2023.",
  "Elden Ring: GOTY Edition, releasing in 2024.",
  "Final Fantasy XVI came out in 2023."
)

years <- str_extract(release_info, "\\b\\d{4}\\b")

print(years)
```


---

### Match words using patterns

Identify words that start with G or R

```{r, eval=TRUE}
text <- c("God of War is great", "Ragnarok is a masterpiece", "Mario Kart rules")

# Find words starting with G or R
matches <- str_extract_all(text, "\\b[G|R]\\w+")

print(matches)

```

---

### R Packages

- Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code.
- Extend the functionality of base R.
- Simplifies complex tasks.
- Widely used for specialized analyses.

E.g., [`tidy`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/), [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

---

### Installing & Loading Packages

- Installation
   - Use the `install.packages()` function to install a package from CRAN.
   
```{r, eval= FALSE}
install.packages("tidyr")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("lubridate")

```

- Loading
   - Use the `library()` function to load an installed package.

```{r, eval= TRUE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
```

- Check the package documentation with `?`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?tidyr
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?dplyr
```


***N.B. Packages only need to be installed once but must be loaded in each session `library()`. Keep packages updated with `update.packages()`***

---

### Lubridate Package

[`Lubridate`](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) is a package that makes working with dates easier. 
- [`Lubridate` Cheat Sheet](https://rawgit.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/lubridate.pdf)
- It provides easy functions to parse, manipulate, and extract date-time components.

.small-code[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("lubridate") # only once
library(lubridate) # everytime you start R
```
]

Key Functions:
- Parsing Dates and Times:
   - `ymd()`, `dmy()`, `mdy(`): Convert strings to dates.
   - `ymd_hms()`, `mdy_hms()`: Handle date-time strings with hours, minutes, seconds.
- Extracting Components:
   - `year()`, `month()`, `day()`: Extract parts of a date.
   - `hour()`, `minute()`, `second()`: Extract time components.
- Manipulating Dates:
   - `today()`, `now()`: Current date or date-time.
   - Arithmetic: Add or subtract days, months, etc.
- Time Zones:
   - Set or change time zones with `with_tz()` or `force_tz()`.

---

**TRY: Play with dates**

.small-code[
```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(lubridate)

# Parse a date
my_date <- ymd("2023-01-01")

# Parse a date-time
my_datetime <- ymd_hms("2023-01-01 12:34:56")

# Extract components
year(my_date)    # 2023
month(my_date)   # 1
day(my_date)     # 1
hour(my_datetime) # 12

# Add 7 days
future_date <- my_date + days(7)

# Set a time zone
new_timezone <- with_tz(my_datetime, tzone = "America/New_York")
print(new_timezone)
```
